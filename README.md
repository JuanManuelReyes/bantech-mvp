> **MVP** - Final project for Holberton School Foundations program.

All your bank information in one place.

## Description ðŸ“‘

The main goal of ``BanTech`` is to **consolidate** all your company's financial information into one place, with an easy way of linking your bank accounts into our app.
Once you have created your BanTech account and linked your bank accounts, you could see all your bank's metrics in our practical Dashboard.

BanTech is a solution of **open banking**. We decided to focus our app on companies because they usually have lots of bank accounts and face the challenges of trying to
consolidate bank information into typically an **excel**, our solution can solve this "excel problem". For the moment we support only banks in Uruguay.

To solve this problem we use a third-party ``API`` (Application Programming Interface) --> [Datanomik](https://www.datanomik.com/en/).
This API allows us to link your bank accounts to our app, we trust Datanomik because they complied with all the [security standards](https://docs.datanomik.com/docs/about-security).
